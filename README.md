# FilmSphere
The final project of the Database exam, which I created with Lorenzo Leoncini. Also thanks to this project, I got a 30 in the exam.
FilmSphere is a movie streaming service, whose database we have implemented here. The project includes:
- ER scheme, restructured or otherwise, relating to the company (among other things, users, their preferences and billing information, movie formats, servers that make up the CDN, subscription plans);
- Documentation, which thoroughly justifies the creation of the database, complete with normalization, introduction of redundancies and tables of volumes and accesses;
- SQL implementation of tables, operations and redundancies, with database population and insertion of constraints.

14 data operations are studied and implemented, and 4 types of redundancies are introduced.
